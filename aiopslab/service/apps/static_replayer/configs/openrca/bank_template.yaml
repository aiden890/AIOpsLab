# OpenRCA Bank Dataset Configuration Template

dataset:
  type: openrca
  namespace: Bank  # Base dataset name (Bank, Telecom, Market)
  path: /datasets  # Path inside container (mounted from host)

simulation:
  # How to determine simulation start time:
  # - 'fault_time': Use current time when container starts (in specified timezone)
  # - 'absolute': Use specific time from absolute_start_time field
  start_time_option: fault_time

  # Timezone for interpreting current time when container starts (IANA timezone names)
  # This is used to read current time in your timezone, then converted to UTC
  # All operations, timestamps, and logs will be in UTC
  # Examples: UTC, America/New_York, America/Los_Angeles, Europe/London,
  #           Asia/Seoul, Asia/Shanghai, Asia/Tokyo
  # Default: UTC
  timezone: Asia/Seoul  # Read current time in KST, convert to UTC for all operations

  # Offset from fault time to start simulation (in minutes)
  # 0 = simulation starts at fault time
  # -5 = simulation starts 5 minutes before fault
  # 5 = simulation starts 5 minutes after fault
  offset_minutes: 0

  # For 'absolute' mode only: specific time to start simulation
  # Format: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
  # If no timezone suffix, uses 'timezone' field above
  # absolute_start_time: "2026-02-11T10:00:00"

time_mapping:
  # Historical fault time from dataset (in China/UTC+8 for OpenRCA)
  # Format: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS)
  # From record.csv: 2021-03-04 14:57:00 (China time)
  historical_fault_time: "2021-03-04T14:57:00"

telemetry:
  # Which telemetry types to replay
  enabled: [trace, log, metric]

  # Historical data window before simulation start (in minutes)
  # This data is bulk-loaded in Phase 1
  history_window_minutes: 30

  streaming:
    # Enable Phase 2 real-time streaming after history
    enabled: true

    # How long to stream data after simulation start (in minutes)
    streaming_window_minutes: 30

    # Streaming speed multiplier
    # 1.0 = real-time, 2.0 = 2x speed, 0.5 = half speed
    speed: 1.0

    # Batch interval for writing streaming data (in seconds)
    batch_interval_seconds: 1

  # Output path inside container (mounted to host)
